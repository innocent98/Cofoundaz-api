# Cofoundaz API — Master Build Checklist

> **Purpose:** the single, always-current bird's-eye map of the whole backend build — what's
> shipped, what's in progress, what's ahead. Kept as task lists so progress is visible at a
> glance. Complements per-change **specs** (`docs/superpowers/specs/`), **plans**
> (`docs/superpowers/plans/`), and **SOPs** (`docs/sop/`); this file is the index that spans
> them all and never gets archived.
>
> **Source of truth for scope:** `../Cofoundaz_Technical_PRD.md` + the UI handoff in `../cofoundaz/`.
> **Convention:** update on new scope (map it in *before* building), on planning (mirror task
> breakdown), and on shipping (check off + note PR/commit). An item is checked **only when done
> and verified**.

_Last reconciled: 2026-08-27 · production deployment hardening pass **plus a code/quality/security scanning wave**, on an uncommitted working tree on `main` (docker-compose.prod.yml, hardened Dockerfile, **10-job CI**, CodeQL workflow, Dependabot, CD workflow, readiness endpoint — nothing committed yet)_

---

## ✅ Module 06 — Health Score — *shipped (PR #6, merged `0f8523c`)*

_Explainable 0–100 score · 5 dimension sub-scores · trend history · benchmarks · ranked recommendations._

**Design (brainstorming):**
- [x] Resolve computation/recompute model → **A: inline recompute + lazy-on-read, no worker**
- [x] Reconcile dimension naming → **keep internal keys `product/market/money/legal/team` (reuse `Dimension` enum); "Financial" is `money`'s display label only**
- [x] Signal-sourcing scope → **C: build `health_signals` now (assessment-derived), weights as static versioned config, defer `health_dimensions` table**
- [x] Pre-assessment state → **A: honest pending empty-state (no row until first assessment; `healthscore.initialize` still enqueued at onboarding-complete but stays unconsumed by design)**
- [x] Recommendations engine scope → **A: rule-based + persisted (`health_recommendations`, dedupe, never resurrect dismissed)**
- [x] Benchmarks scope → **A: honest empty-state with cohort-size gate (no aggregation pipeline built now)**
- [x] Band thresholds + weekly-delta / drop / record semantics — implemented in `app/services/health_score/config.py` + `scoring.py`
- [x] `healthscore.recalculate` stub replaced by the inline recompute at assessment-complete; `healthscore.initialize` (onboarding) intentionally left as an unconsumed stub — see `docs/sop/2026-08-19-health-score.md`
- [x] Spec written → self-review → user review gate → writing-plans (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-19-health-score/`)
- [x] Endpoints: `GET /health-score` · `/dimensions/{dim}` · `/history?range` · `/benchmarks` · `/recommendations` · `POST /recommendations/{id}/{accept,dismiss}`
- [x] Data model: `health_scores` · `health_score_history` · `health_signals` + `health_recommendations` + migration `0005`
- [x] Events: `healthscore.updated` · `healthscore.dropped` · `healthscore.record`
- [x] Live E2E + SOP + **FE integration guide (captured live)** — `e2e/test_health_score.py`, `docs/sop/2026-08-19-health-score.md`, `docs/fe-integration-guide-health-score.md`
- [ ] _Deferred:_ real benchmark cohort aggregation · async worker for the unconsumed stub jobs (Module 05) · AI-generated summary/recommendations (Module 03) — see SOP Follow-ups

## 🟡 Module 05 — Roadmap — *in progress (decomposed into 3 slices)*

_Decomposed in brainstorming: each slice = its own spec → plan → build → PR._

**Slice 1 — Core** — *✅ merged (PR #7, `5fef521`)*
- [x] Scope split + locked decisions (stage-only catalog · role-based access · generate honors job contract inline · derived progress/explicit status · inline+lazy)
- [x] Enums (`RoadmapStatus`, `TaskEffort`) + 5 models (`roadmaps`/`roadmap_phases`/`roadmap_milestones`/`roadmap_tasks`/`roadmap_task_dependencies`) + factories
- [x] Migration `0006_roadmap`
- [x] `require_roles(founder, team_member)` editor dep + tenancy resolvers
- [x] Template catalog + `generate_roadmap` (create-once `ON CONFLICT` + race test) + `roadmap.generated`
- [x] `recompute_milestone_progress` + `GET /roadmap` (tree serialize + lazy generate)
- [x] `POST /roadmap/generate` (202 job) + wire inline into `complete_onboarding` (retire stub)
- [x] Phases CRUD · Milestones CRUD (+ mark-complete transition event) · Tasks CRUD (+ progress recompute)
- [x] Live E2E + SOP + FE integration guide (captured live) — `e2e/test_roadmap.py`, `docs/sop/2026-08-21-roadmap-core.md`, `docs/fe-integration-guide-roadmap.md`
- [ ] _Deferred:_ `roadmap.milestone.overdue` event + notifications (Module 20, needs scheduler) · workspace-tz base date

**Slice 2 — Dependencies + Templates** — *✅ done (branch `feat/roadmap-deps-templates`, Tasks 1–9; not yet merged to `main`)*
- [x] Scope + locked decisions (separate gallery catalog · apply = append + dedup by template id · write-time DFS cycle detection · duplicate-edge idempotent 200 · dedicated graph endpoint)
- [x] `GALLERY_TEMPLATES` static catalog (named, industry-tagged packs) + counts helper
- [x] Migration `0007_roadmap_applied_templates` (`applied_template_keys` JSONB on `roadmaps`)
- [x] `dependencies.py` — `would_create_cycle` (DFS reachability) + `add_dependency`
- [x] `POST`/`DELETE /roadmap/tasks/{id}/dependencies` (cycle → 409 `DEPENDENCY_CYCLE`, dup → idempotent 200)
- [x] `GET /roadmap/dependencies` graph + populate tree `depends_on`/`dependency_count`
- [x] `GET /roadmap/templates` gallery + `GET /roadmap/templates/{id}` preview
- [x] `POST /roadmap/templates/{id}/apply` (append + dedup + `roadmap.template.applied`)
- [x] Live E2E extension + SOP + FE integration guide update — `e2e/test_roadmap.py` (extended), `docs/sop/2026-08-22-roadmap-deps-templates.md`, `docs/fe-integration-guide-roadmap.md` (updated)
- [ ] _Deferred:_ `add_dependency`/`apply_template` no-row-lock race under concurrent double-calls (benign, same class as Slice 1's `_next_order`) · `roadmap.template.applied` has no consumer until Module 20

**Slice 3 — AI Re-plan** — *planned*
- [ ] Drift detection · `POST /roadmap/replan/preview` (before/after diff) · `POST /roadmap/replan/apply {change_ids[]}` (consume `roadmap.replan`) · `roadmap.replanned` event · never auto-applies

---

## ✅ Deployment & Infrastructure — *shipped 2026-08-27, uncommitted working tree*

_Production docker/compose hardening, CI/CD pipeline rework, and a real readiness endpoint —
all verified locally; nothing has touched a real VPS or GitHub Actions yet. See
`docs/sop/2026-08-27-production-deployment-hardening.md`._

- [x] `docker-compose.prod.yml` — no host-published Postgres/Redis, `migrate` one-shot gated by
      `service_completed_successfully`, resource limits, json-file log rotation, own compose
      project name (`cofoundaz-api-prod`) so `down -v` can't touch the dev stack's volumes
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` made honestly dev-only
- [x] Production `Dockerfile` rewritten — Poetry 2.2.1 (was 1.8.4, couldn't read the
      lock-version 2.1 lockfile), tini + gunicorn/uvicorn workers, `libpq-dev`/pip/setuptools/wheel
      removed from the runtime image (396 MB → 376 MB)
- [x] `poetry.lock` un-gitignored and git-staged for reproducible builds
- [x] `.dockerignore` inverted to deny-by-default; `.env.production.example` added; real-looking
      `SECRET_KEY` in `.env.example` replaced with a placeholder
- [x] CI (`ci.yml`): 1 job → **10**. First pass took it to 6 — `lint` (now incl. mypy), `test` on Postgres 17 with a 95%
      coverage gate, `migrations` (single-head + fresh upgrade + `alembic check` + downgrade
      round-trip), `e2e`, `security` (gitleaks + Semgrep + pip-audit), `build` (image + smoke +
      Trivy); plus a shared `setup-python-poetry` composite action, SHA-pinned actions,
      least-privilege `permissions:` and concurrency groups. The scanning wave added 4 more —
      `quality`, `trivy-repo`, `dependency-review`, `sonarcloud` — leaving 8 jobs fully parallel,
      `sonarcloud` on `needs: [test]`, and `build` on
      `needs: [lint, quality, test, migrations, e2e, security, trivy-repo]`
- [x] `GET /api/v1/health/ready` — checks Postgres + Redis, `503` naming the failed dependency,
      no DSN leak (7 tests); `/health` kept as a cheap liveness check
- [x] Security-exception scaffolding — `.trivyignore` / `.github/security/pip-audit-ignores.txt`
      created, currently suppress nothing
- [x] Semgrep (CI ruleset, severity ERROR) verified clean locally — exit 0, no findings
- [ ] **Code scanning** — `codeql.yml` authored, `actionlint` clean, **NEVER EXECUTED**
      (CodeQL cannot run locally). Own workflow: needs a weekly cron, which in
      `ci.yml` would run the whole pipeline weekly). Python `security-and-quality`
      suite, report-only. Complements Semgrep: CodeQL does interprocedural
      dataflow/taint tracking, Semgrep is single-window pattern matching
- [x] **Quality scanning** — `quality` job: pylint wired up at last (it was a
      declared dev dep CI never ran) with a scoped `[tool.pylint]` config,
      **9.94/10** measured, gate `--fail-under=9.5`; radon complexity/MI report
      (301 blocks, average **A (2.30)**, every module MI **A**); hadolint on the
      Dockerfile at the strictest threshold
- [x] Complexity gate via ruff `C901` (`max-complexity = 12`; measured worst is
      `validate_answer` at 11) — one enforcer, radon reports only
- [x] **bandit** Python SAST in the `security` job — 3 findings, all false
      positives, fixed with inline `# nosec` + written reasons; now exits 0
- [x] **hadolint** — DL3066 FIXED (`USER 1000:1000`, not ignored); only DL3008
      ignored, with justification in `.hadolint.yaml`. Exits 0
- [x] **Trivy beyond the image** — `trivy fs` (report-only; finds the locked graph
      incl. unfixable `ecdsa CVE-2024-23342`, plus 0 secrets) and `trivy config`
      (BLOCKS; **0 misconfigurations** on the hardened Dockerfile)
- [x] **SBOM** — CycloneDX 1.7 from the built image, **174 components** (173 library +
      1 operating-system), ~301 KB — generated and counted locally
- [ ] SBOM as a *workflow artifact* (`sbom-cyclonedx-<sha>`, 90-day retention) —
      **NOT VERIFIED**, never uploaded; likewise the SLSA provenance + SBOM
      attestations CD attaches to the GHCR manifest, since no GHCR push has happened.
      cosign signing was deliberately declined — CD deploys the digest it just built,
      and without a `cosign verify` gate that can refuse a deploy a signature is ceremony
- [ ] **`dependency-review`** job on pull requests — authored (blocks a PR that
      *introduces* a high-severity or copyleft-licensed dependency); **NEVER EXECUTED**,
      it needs a real PR to diff a manifest against a base commit
- [ ] **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — pip / github-actions / docker, authored; what keeps
      the SHA and digest pins moving rather than rotting (pinning *without* an update
      mechanism is strictly worse than not pinning). **NEVER RUN** — needs enabling, and
      the Docker digest PRs specifically need confirming (see follow-ups)
- [x] Distinct SARIF `category:` per scan mode (semgrep / codeql / trivy-fs /
      trivy-config / trivy-image) so Security-tab results don't overwrite
- [x] All **18** Action SHA pins verified against the live GitHub API — zero
      mismatches; every action input validated against its pinned `action.yml`
- [x] `make quality` / `make scan` / `make sbom` reproduce the CI scanning locally —
      `make quality` exit 0; `make scan` runs 6 stages (bandit PASS, Semgrep PASS,
      gitleaks "no leaks found", `trivy config` PASS, `trivy fs` 7 HIGH and continues
      as report-only, `trivy image` 6 HIGH → exit 1, blocking as designed)
- [x] `bandit ^1.9.4` + `radon ^6.0.1` added as dev deps — resolution clean, **8 installs,
      0 updates** to existing packages; `pylint` was already declared but CI never ran it
- [x] **`python-multipart` 0.0.20 → 0.0.32** (approved) — only that package moved
      (122 packages before and after). `trivy image` **6 → 3**, `pip-audit`
      **16 → 10**, `trivy fs` **7 → 4**. Live consumer is the `/onboarding/logo`
      multipart upload (not login, which is a JSON body); re-verified via 4 logo
      unit tests, 11 auth e2e journeys and the onboarding upload journey
- [x] **Checkov** wired for `github_actions` — **47 passed / 0 failed / 1
      documented skip**; caught `CKV_GHA_7` on `cd.yml` first run. NOT used for
      compose: Checkov 3.3.15 has no `docker_compose` framework (verified — zero
      results), so a compose job there could never fail
- [x] **VPS target spec CONFIRMED at 4 vCPU / 8 GB / 80 GB SSD** — restated in
      `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `docs/deployment/` as a confirmed spec rather
      than an assumption. Nominal CPU sums to 4.5 but `api` and `migrate` are
      mutually exclusive (`service_completed_successfully`), so real peaks are
      2.5 (migrating) and **exactly 4.0** (steady state); memory 5632M of 8192M
      leaves 2560M for host + page cache. Connections 42/100 (42%)
- [ ] **SonarCloud** — `sonar-project.properties` committed but INERT; the job
      skips cleanly until a `SONAR_TOKEN` secret exists. Needs a SonarCloud
      account (could not be created here)
- [x] `.gitleaksignore` baselines the one historical `SECRET_KEY` committed to `.env.example` in
      `36ee5d51`; gitleaks over all 158 commits then passes clean
- [x] Full production stack verified locally end-to-end — migration gate, resource limits
      (`docker inspect`), read-only rootfs, graceful shutdown (1s, exit 0), readiness
      `200`→`503` on Redis outage
- [ ] `cd.yml` (build/push GHCR + SSH deploy + automatic rollback) — authored, `actionlint` /
      `shellcheck` clean, **never executed on GitHub**
- [ ] _Deferred:_ Trivy/pip-audit CVE debt (`python-multipart`, `starlette`, `ecdsa` via
      `python-jose`) — CI expected red until triaged · real VPS deploy (SSH, nginx, UFW, GHCR
      push/pull) never attempted · CPU reservations are no-ops outside Swarm (memory
      reservations do apply) · `UvicornWorker` deprecated upstream (works on uvicorn 0.32.1)

## ⬜ Upcoming (from PRD — mapped as we reach each)

- [ ] **Module 04 — Today's Mission**
- [ ] **Module 03 — AI Co-Founder** (unblocks deferred AI narratives/recommendations/panels)
- [ ] **Module 20 — Notifications** (real delivery + quarterly re-assessment cron)
- [ ] **Module 17 — Learning Academy** — *junior handoff prepared* · brief `docs/handoff/module-17-learning-academy.md` · planned blueprint `docs/architecture/planned/modules-17-21-junior-handoff.md`
- [ ] **Module 21 — Founder Journal** — *junior handoff prepared* · brief `docs/handoff/module-21-founder-journal.md` · planned blueprint `docs/architecture/planned/modules-17-21-junior-handoff.md`
- [ ] Remaining PRD modules — to be mapped into their own sections as scope firms up

**Reference docs:** system architecture blueprint `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` (sync/verify after each module); planned-module blueprints under `docs/architecture/planned/`.

---

## Deferred follow-ups (tracked, non-blocking)

- [ ] `complete_assessment` should return `job_ids` (parity with `complete_onboarding`)
- [ ] Index `assessments.created_by` FK
- [ ] `compare` error distinction (in-progress vs not-found) if FE needs it
- [ ] `team_size` scoring tie edge case
- [ ] `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set per environment (empty → 500)
- [x] Commit `poetry.lock` (currently gitignored) before reproducible deploy — *un-gitignored and
      git-staged 2026-08-27; still needs an actual commit, nothing is committed yet*
- [ ] `LocalStorage` returns a filesystem path, not an HTTP URL — `logo_url` not FE-renderable until a URL-returning storage backend lands
- [ ] No async worker draining `jobs` yet (Modules 05/06 decide)
- [ ] Trivy: **3 HIGH** remaining (all `starlette` 0.46.2; was 6 before the
      `python-multipart` bump). 0 CRITICAL, zero OS-package findings. Nothing
      suppressed in `.trivyignore`; CI's `build` job is expected red until triaged
- [ ] `pip-audit`: **10 advisories** remaining — `starlette` (9) + `ecdsa` 0.19.2
      (`PYSEC-2026-1325`, no fix, via `python-jose`); was 16. Nothing suppressed
      in `.github/security/pip-audit-ignores.txt`
- [ ] Migrate `python-jose` → `PyJWT` to drop the unfixable `ecdsa` advisory
      (`CVE-2024-23342` / `PYSEC-2026-1325`, the Minerva attack — surfaced by
      `trivy fs`, hidden from the image scan by `--ignore-unfixed`)
- [ ] Refactor `validate_answer` (`app/services/assessment/engine.py`) so ruff's
      `max-complexity` can drop 12 → the common default of 10. It is the only
      function above 10
- [ ] Enable SonarCloud (create project, replace the CHANGE_ME `projectKey` /
      `organization`, add `SONAR_TOKEN`) — see `docs/deployment/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`
- [ ] Triage the first CodeQL baseline, then decide whether to promote it from
      report-only to blocking via branch-protection code-scanning requirements
- [ ] Confirm Dependabot actually opens Docker **digest** PRs — the digest lives in
      an `ARG PYTHON_IMAGE=...` default rather than a bare `FROM` literal, which its
      Docker parser is not guaranteed to follow. If nothing appears within two
      weeks of enabling, refresh by hand and treat as unverified
- [ ] **Both compose files remain unscanned by any IaC tool.** `trivy config`
      targets Dockerfile/K8s/Terraform/CloudFormation/Helm; Checkov 3.3.15 has no
      `docker_compose` framework at all. Closing this needs a compose-specific
      linter, not another general IaC scanner
- [ ] `starlette` 0.46.2 — **3 HIGH** still blocking `trivy image`. Stays pinned
      even with fastapi 0.141.1, so it needs real compatibility work (starlette
      1.x is a major version, not a drop-in)
- [ ] CodeQL, `dependency-review` and SonarCloud have **never executed** — none can
      run locally; first signal comes from the first GitHub Actions run/PR
- [ ] The `SECRET_KEY` committed to `.env.example` in `36ee5d51` is public in git history and must
      be treated as compromised — confirm no deployed environment ever used it; clearing it from
      history needs `git-filter-repo` + force-push + everyone re-cloning
- [ ] Production deploy path (`docker-compose.prod.yml`, hardened `Dockerfile`, `cd.yml`) has
      never been exercised against a real VPS — no SSH deploy, no nginx, no UFW, no GHCR
      push/pull; the workflows have never executed on GitHub
- [ ] `deploy.resources.reservations.cpus` is declarative-only outside Swarm (verified
      `CpuShares`/`CpuQuota`/`CpuPeriod` all `0` on Compose v2.40.3) — memory reservations do apply
- [ ] `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` is deprecated upstream in favour of the `uvicorn-worker`
      package — works today on uvicorn 0.32.1
- [ ] Local venv runs Python 3.14 while the project targets 3.11 (CI uses 3.11) — pre-existing,
      not introduced by the deployment hardening pass
