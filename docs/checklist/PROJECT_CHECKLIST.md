# Cofoundaz API — Master Build Checklist

> **Purpose:** the single, always-current bird's-eye map of the whole backend build — what's
> shipped, what's in progress, what's ahead. Kept as task lists so progress is visible at a
> glance. Complements per-change **specs** (`docs/superpowers/specs/`), **plans**
> (`docs/superpowers/plans/`), and **SOPs** (`docs/sop/`); this file is the index that spans
> them all and never gets archived.
>
> **Source of truth for scope:** `../Cofoundaz_Technical_PRD.md` + the UI handoff in `../cofoundaz/`.
> **Convention:** update on new scope (map it in *before* building), on planning (mirror task
> breakdown), and on shipping (check off + note PR/commit). An item is checked **only when done
> and verified**.

---

## ✅ Module 06 — Health Score — *shipped (PR #6, merged `0f8523c`)*

_Explainable 0–100 score · 5 dimension sub-scores · trend history · benchmarks · ranked recommendations._

**Design (brainstorming):**
- [x] Resolve computation/recompute model → **A: inline recompute + lazy-on-read, no worker**
- [x] Reconcile dimension naming → **keep internal keys `product/market/money/legal/team` (reuse `Dimension` enum); "Financial" is `money`'s display label only**
- [x] Signal-sourcing scope → **C: build `health_signals` now (assessment-derived), weights as static versioned config, defer `health_dimensions` table**
- [x] Pre-assessment state → **A: honest pending empty-state (no row until first assessment; `healthscore.initialize` still enqueued at onboarding-complete but stays unconsumed by design)**
- [x] Recommendations engine scope → **A: rule-based + persisted (`health_recommendations`, dedupe, never resurrect dismissed)**
- [x] Benchmarks scope → **A: honest empty-state with cohort-size gate (no aggregation pipeline built now)**
- [x] Band thresholds + weekly-delta / drop / record semantics — implemented in `app/services/health_score/config.py` + `scoring.py`
- [x] `healthscore.recalculate` stub replaced by the inline recompute at assessment-complete; `healthscore.initialize` (onboarding) intentionally left as an unconsumed stub — see `docs/sop/2026-08-19-health-score.md`
- [x] Spec written → self-review → user review gate → writing-plans (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-19-health-score/`)
- [x] Endpoints: `GET /health-score` · `/dimensions/{dim}` · `/history?range` · `/benchmarks` · `/recommendations` · `POST /recommendations/{id}/{accept,dismiss}`
- [x] Data model: `health_scores` · `health_score_history` · `health_signals` + `health_recommendations` + migration `0005`
- [x] Events: `healthscore.updated` · `healthscore.dropped` · `healthscore.record`
- [x] Live E2E + SOP + **FE integration guide (captured live)** — `e2e/test_health_score.py`, `docs/sop/2026-08-19-health-score.md`, `docs/fe-integration-guide-health-score.md`
- [ ] _Deferred:_ real benchmark cohort aggregation · async worker for the unconsumed stub jobs (Module 05) · AI-generated summary/recommendations (Module 03) — see SOP Follow-ups

## 🟡 Module 05 — Roadmap — *in progress (decomposed into 3 slices)*

_Decomposed in brainstorming: each slice = its own spec → plan → build → PR._

**Slice 1 — Core** — *✅ merged (PR #7, `5fef521`)*
- [x] Scope split + locked decisions (stage-only catalog · role-based access · generate honors job contract inline · derived progress/explicit status · inline+lazy)
- [x] Enums (`RoadmapStatus`, `TaskEffort`) + 5 models (`roadmaps`/`roadmap_phases`/`roadmap_milestones`/`roadmap_tasks`/`roadmap_task_dependencies`) + factories
- [x] Migration `0006_roadmap`
- [x] `require_roles(founder, team_member)` editor dep + tenancy resolvers
- [x] Template catalog + `generate_roadmap` (create-once `ON CONFLICT` + race test) + `roadmap.generated`
- [x] `recompute_milestone_progress` + `GET /roadmap` (tree serialize + lazy generate)
- [x] `POST /roadmap/generate` (202 job) + wire inline into `complete_onboarding` (retire stub)
- [x] Phases CRUD · Milestones CRUD (+ mark-complete transition event) · Tasks CRUD (+ progress recompute)
- [x] Live E2E + SOP + FE integration guide (captured live) — `e2e/test_roadmap.py`, `docs/sop/2026-08-21-roadmap-core.md`, `docs/fe-integration-guide-roadmap.md`
- [ ] _Deferred:_ `roadmap.milestone.overdue` event + notifications (Module 20, needs scheduler) · workspace-tz base date

**Slice 2 — Dependencies + Templates** — *planned*
- [ ] `POST /roadmap/tasks/{id}/dependencies` + cycle detection · dependency graph read
- [ ] `GET /roadmap/templates` gallery + `POST /roadmap/templates/{id}/apply` (non-destructive merge)
- [ ] Industry template variants (Fintech/B2C/Nigeria overlays)

**Slice 3 — AI Re-plan** — *planned*
- [ ] Drift detection · `POST /roadmap/replan/preview` (before/after diff) · `POST /roadmap/replan/apply {change_ids[]}` (consume `roadmap.replan`) · `roadmap.replanned` event · never auto-applies

---

## ⬜ Upcoming (from PRD — mapped as we reach each)

- [ ] **Module 04 — Today's Mission**
- [ ] **Module 03 — AI Co-Founder** (unblocks deferred AI narratives/recommendations/panels)
- [ ] **Module 20 — Notifications** (real delivery + quarterly re-assessment cron)
- [ ] Remaining PRD modules — to be mapped into their own sections as scope firms up

---

## Deferred follow-ups (tracked, non-blocking)

- [ ] `complete_assessment` should return `job_ids` (parity with `complete_onboarding`)
- [ ] Index `assessments.created_by` FK
- [ ] `compare` error distinction (in-progress vs not-found) if FE needs it
- [ ] `team_size` scoring tie edge case
- [ ] `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set per environment (empty → 500)
- [ ] Commit `poetry.lock` (currently gitignored) before reproducible deploy
- [ ] `LocalStorage` returns a filesystem path, not an HTTP URL — `logo_url` not FE-renderable until a URL-returning storage backend lands
- [ ] No async worker draining `jobs` yet (Modules 05/06 decide)
