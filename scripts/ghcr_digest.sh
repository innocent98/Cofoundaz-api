# Resolve a GHCR reference (tag or digest) to its immutable manifest digest.
#
#   scripts/ghcr_digest.sh <repository-path> <reference>
#
#   <repository-path>  lowercase owner/name, e.g. innocent98/cofoundaz-api
#   <reference>        a tag (sha-a1b2c3d) or a digest (sha256:...)
#
# Prints the digest (sha256:...) on stdout. Everything else goes to stderr, so
# the caller can safely do  DIGEST="$(scripts/ghcr_digest.sh ...)".
#
# EXIT CODES - the caller distinguishes these, so they are part of the contract:
#   0  resolved; the digest is on stdout
#   2  the reference does not exist in the registry (HTTP 404)
#   1  anything else (auth failure, network, malformed response)
#
# Exit 2 is separate from exit 1 ON PURPOSE. "this image was never built" and
# "the registry rejected our credentials" demand completely different responses
# from a deploy pipeline, and collapsing them into one non-zero exit is how a
# credentials outage gets misdiagnosed as an un-promotable commit.
#
# AUTHENTICATION
#   Set GHCR_USERNAME and GHCR_PASSWORD for a private package (in Actions:
#   GHCR_USERNAME=${{ github.actor }}, GHCR_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
#   with `permissions: packages: read`). With neither set, an anonymous pull
#   token is requested, which works for public packages - that is the path this
#   script was verified against locally, since the project's own package is
#   private and unreachable from a developer machine without a PAT.
#
# WHY THE RAW REGISTRY API AND NOT `docker buildx imagetools inspect`
#   imagetools collapses "not found" and "not authorised" into a generic
#   non-zero exit with prose on stderr, so the pipeline would have to pattern
#   match English error text to tell them apart. A HEAD against the manifest
#   endpoint returns an unambiguous status code, needs no docker daemon, and
#   costs one HTTP round trip.
